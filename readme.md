# Re-learning the basics

> The most valuable acquisitions in a scientific or technical education are the general-purpose mental tools which remain serviceable for a life-time.

-- George Forsythe

After finishing my last programming course in school, I slowly stopped solving technically-challenging problems. That was mostly due to the changing nature of courses, the more advanced courses got, the more abstract ideas they covered. Advanced courses were focusing on expanding my breadth of knowledge in the CS field, rather than technical depth.
To fix this, I started this repo, where I try to write 1 algorithm a day, in an attempt to re-learn [this](https://doc.lagout.org/science/0_Computer%20Science/2_Algorithms/Introduction%20to%20the%20Design%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Algorithms%20%283rd%20ed.%29%20%5BLevitin%202011-10-09%5D.pdf) book (one of my favorites in school) to keep my programming skills sharp and to better understand the syntax of Python. Maybe I'll visualize some problems if I felt extra cool that day. However, the goal is to 'code every day'.

The format these notebooks follow is code discussion & summaries. These notebooks summarize, implement and discuss the lessons & algorithms covered in this book and its exercises.

## Notebooks

1. [1.1 What's an Algorithm?](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ANFALATAWI/Relearning-the-Basics/blob/main/Chapter%201/1-1.ipynb)
2. [1.1 Exercises](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ANFALATAWI/Relearning-the-Basics/blob/main/Chapter%201/Exercises%201-1.ipynb)
3. [1.3 Important Problem Types](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ANFALATAWI/Relearning-the-Basics/blob/main/Chapter%201/1-3%20Important%20Problem%20Types.ipynb)
4. [1.3 Exercises](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ANFALATAWI/Relearning-the-Basics/blob/main/Chapter%201/Exercises%201-3.ipynb)

I think of this almost as code diaries. People want to read everyday, write everyday, I want to program and solve problems everyday. This is a skill I acquired that I would never want to lose.
