# Re-learning the basics


> The most valuable acquisitons in a scienttific or technical education are the general-purpose mental tools which remain servicable for a life-time.

-- George Forsythe

After finishing my last programming course in school, I slowly stopped solving techincally-challenging problems. That was mostly due to the changing nature of courses, the more advanced courses got, the more abstract ideas they covered. Advanced courses were focusing on expanding my breadth of knowledge in the CS field, rather than technical depth.
To fix this, I started this repo, where I try to write 1 algorithm a day, in an attempt to re-learn [this](https://doc.lagout.org/science/0_Computer%20Science/2_Algorithms/Introduction%20to%20the%20Design%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Algorithms%20%283rd%20ed.%29%20%5BLevitin%202011-10-09%5D.pdf) book (one of my favourites in school) to keep my programming skills sharp and to better understand the syntax of Python. Maybe I'll visualise some problems if I felt extra cool that day. However, the goal is to 'code every day'.

I think of this almost as code diaries. People want to read everyday, write everyday, I want to program and solve problems everyday. This is a skill I acquiried that I would never want to lose.
